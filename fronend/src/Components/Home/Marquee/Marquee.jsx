          Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that
          has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative,
          and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as
          strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition
          to stabilizers.
